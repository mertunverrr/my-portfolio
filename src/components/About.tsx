            I was born on September 5, 2001. I completed my high school
            education at TOKÄ° Anatolian High School in Ankara. Following my high
            school graduation, I earned my degree in Computer Engineering from
            Ankara University after four years, graduating in 2023. Currently, I
            am actively seeking full-time employment as a frontend developer. I
            am highly motivated and committed to self-improvement. I am eagerly
            looking forward to working in a company where I can continuously
            learn new things and contribute effectively.
